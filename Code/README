GroupChat Application
This repository contains the code for a simple GroupChat application implemented using Python and ZeroMQ. The application consists of three main components:

User.py: This script runs on the local computer and allows users to interact with the GroupChat application. Users can join groups, send messages, fetch messages, and leave groups.

messageServer.py: This script runs on a Google Cloud (GLC) VM instance and serves as the central server for managing group registrations and providing information about available groups to users.

groupServer.py: This script also runs on a GLC VM instance and manages the groups. It handles user registrations, message storage, and retrieval within groups.

Install Dependencies: Ensure that you have Python and ZeroMQ installed on your local machine and GLC VM instances.

Running the Servers:

Start the messageServer.py script on the GLC VM instance.
Start the groupServer.py script on another GLC VM instance.
Running the User Client:

Run the user.py script on your local computer.
Follow the prompts to interact with the GroupChat application as a user.

Usage
User Interaction: Users can perform various actions through the command-line interface provided by the user.py script. These actions include joining groups, leaving groups, sending messages, fetching messages, and viewing available groups.

Group Registration: Groups are registered and managed by the groupServer.py script. Users can join existing groups or create new ones through the user interface.

Message Exchange: Messages sent by users are stored and managed by the groupServer.py script. Users can fetch messages from a specific group based on timestamps.
